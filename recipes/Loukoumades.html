    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These simple donuts are made of a simple dough and fried until golden and crispy. Pair with a homemade honey
        syrup and sprinkle with your favorite nuts.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup lukewarm water</li>
        <li>2 tbs sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbs active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flower</li>
        <li>2 tbs cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 cup lukewarm milk</li>
        <li>3 tbs extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
        <li>1/3 cup crushed nuts</li>
        <li>ground cinammon</li>
        <li>powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the syrup</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup honey</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, add the water, sugar and yeast. Stir with a whisk until the yeast dissolves completely and wait
            for 5 minutes. In a mixers bowl add the yeast mixture add the rest of the ingredients for the dough and
            whisk at high speed (for about 2 minutes) until the mixture becomes a smooth batter. (You could also use a
            hand whisk. Whisk until the mixture has no lumps).</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with some plastic wrap and let the dough rest in a warm place for at least 1 hour to rise.
        </li>
        <li>Into a medium sized frying pan pour enough vegetable oil to deep fry the loukoumades. Heat the oil on a
            medium heat until hot. Test if the oil is hot enough by dipping in some of the dough for the loukoumades. If
            it sizzles the oil is ready. A more accurate way is to use a kitchen thermometer and measure the oil to be
            at 160C / 320F.</li>
        <li>Dip a tablespoon in some oil, shake it a bit to remove any excess. It is best to dip the spoon in oil and
            not water. Dip your hand in the dough and using your palm, squeeze out a small portion of dough between your
            thumb and index finger, like you are making a fist. Using the spoon, grab the dough ball off your hand and
            let it drop in the hot oil. Repeat this procedure until the surface off the pan is comfortably filled. You
            should dip the spoon in the oil & shake off every time, so that the batter doesnâ€™t stick on it.</li>
        <li>While the loukoumades are fried, use a slotted spoon to push them into the oil and turn them on all sides,
            until golden brown. Place the loukoumades on some kitchen paper to drain. Repeat with the rest of the dough.
        </li>
        <li>When done, place the loukoumades on kitchen paper to remove the excess oil. Then serve on a large platter,
            drizzle with the honey and sprinkle with cinnamon and chopped walnuts.</li>
    </ol>
